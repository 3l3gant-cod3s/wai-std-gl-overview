## Translation Notes

[Image at the bottom](https://www.w3.org/WAI/content-images/wai-std-gl-overview/specs.png):  For now, it is OK to leave the image in English. (It only illustrates the information above, and does not provided substantial additional information.) We are working on an SVG version of that image, with support for translation. We will update this section and notify existing translators when it is ready.
